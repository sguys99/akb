"""Tests for CollectionService.create.

Mirrors the bootstrap pattern from `test_collection_repo.py`: hits a real
Postgres reachable via `AKB_TEST_DSN` (auto-skip otherwise), applies the
idempotent `init.sql`, and creates an ephemeral vault per test so the
table cascade cleans everything up.

`CollectionService` reaches into `app.db.postgres.get_pool()` for both
the repo wiring and the `emit_event` transaction. We monkeypatch that
function in the service module to hand back the test pool, so the
service code under test is exercised verbatim.
