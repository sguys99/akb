"""Race-safety regressions for pgvector ``ensure_collection``.

Background — 0.6.2 introduced a partial-HNSW migration inside
``ensure_collection``: the legacy full HNSW is dropped and a
``WHERE dense IS NOT NULL`` partial form is built. The first
prod rollout (0.6.3) revealed two failure modes the previous
guards couldn't catch:

1. **Cross-caller race.** When a search request times out, asyncio
   cancels the in-flight ``ensure_collection`` task — including any
   long-running ``CREATE INDEX``. The next request finds
   ``_ensured_collection=False`` and starts another build, and so
   on, ad infinitum. Even at a single uvicorn worker (so no
   true multi-process), the cancellation made it look like four
   concurrent builds were in flight, and no row ever got an index.
2. **Atomicity gap.** The 0.6.2 sequence was ``DROP legacy`` then
   ``CREATE partial``. A ``CREATE INDEX`` failure (OOM, /dev/shm
   too small, cancellation) leaves the schema with no dense index
   at all — every search falls through to a seq scan or returns
   empty.

0.6.4 fixes both with (a) a PG transaction-scoped advisory lock
keyed on the schema name, so cross-process / cross-cancellation
callers serialize; and (b) an atomic-swap pattern: build the new
partial under a temp name, ``DROP`` legacy + ``RENAME`` only when
the build succeeded. These tests assert both invariants against a
real Postgres + pgvector (set ``AKB_TEST_DSN`` to enable; the
suite skips otherwise).
