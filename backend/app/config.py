"""AKB runtime configuration.

Single source: two YAML files merged at import time.

Lookup order (first hit wins):
  1. ./config/app.yaml + ./config/secret.yaml   (CWD-relative; local dev)
  2. /etc/akb/app.yaml + /etc/akb/secret.yaml   (containerised deploys)

The split exists so that `app.yaml` is safe to commit/share (no
secrets) and `secret.yaml` stays out of source control. Both files
are flat YAML mappings using the same keys as the Settings model
below — no environment variables are read.
