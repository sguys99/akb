"""Pgvector driver for VectorStore.

Stores dense + corpus-side BM25 sparse vectors in a Postgres schema
(`vector_index` by default). RRF fusion happens application-side over
two SQL queries (dense KNN + BM25 sum) executed in parallel.

Operator deployment modes (no code change between them):

- Same-instance: `vector_store_dsn` blank → driver uses the main PG
  pool. Main PG must have the `vector` extension installed; the driver
  creates its own schema, so the main `chunks` table is untouched.
- Separate-instance: `vector_store_dsn` set to a different Postgres
  URL → driver opens a dedicated pool. The main PG never gains a
  vector dependency.

Sparse storage shape is selected at construction time:

  posting  — chunks(...) + posting(term_id, chunk_id, weight),
             B-tree-indexed on term_id. Sparse search is a single
             indexed lookup. Default and recommended at any scale
             where you actually care about latency.
  arrays   — chunks(sparse_terms BIGINT[], sparse_weights REAL[]).
             One row per chunk. Sparse search unnest+JOIN+GROUP BY.
             RETAINED for the bench harness only — don't pick this
             for production. May be removed in a future cleanup.

        Three layers of guards, in order:

        1. **Instance flag** — ``_ensured_collection`` short-circuits
           every call after the first successful one within this
           process. The hot path is one bool read.
        2. **asyncio.Lock** — serializes concurrent callers inside the
           same event loop (e.g. lifespan startup + a request handler
           racing on a cold start). The second caller waits, sees the
           flag, returns.
        3. **PG advisory transaction lock** — serializes across worker
           processes / pods sharing the same database. A peer that's
           mid-rebuild holds the lock; we block until it commits (or
           rolls back), then re-check inside the lock and skip the
           build if the peer already produced the artifact.

        Layer (3) was missing pre-0.6.4. The 0.6.2 rebuild of
        `idx_vi_chunks_dense` (partial HNSW) could race against
        itself: a search request that timed out (504) cancelled the
        in-flight CREATE INDEX before it committed; the next request
        saw ``_ensured_collection=False`` and re-issued, ad infinitum.
        Even at a single uvicorn worker the asyncio cancel made it
        look multi-process. Cross-process advisory lock + atomic
        index swap (build under temp name → DROP legacy → RENAME)
        below makes the rebuild forward-progress-safe.

        `conn` is accepted for driver-interface parity (base.py) and
        ignored — we always acquire our own pool conn so the schema
        commit is independent of any caller transaction state.
