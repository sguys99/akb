"""Vector store driver Protocol + shared types.

`VectorStore` is an interface; concrete drivers live in sibling
modules (`qdrant.py`, `pgvector.py`). Service-layer code depends on
the Protocol only — zero driver-specific imports leak past this
package boundary.

Sparse encoding is the *caller's* responsibility:
- `embed_worker` runs `sparse_encoder.encode_document` before upsert.
- `search_service` runs `sparse_encoder.encode_query` before search.

This keeps BM25 logic in one place (vocab + stats live in main PG)
and lets a future non-BM25 driver (SPLADE etc.) accept and ignore the
inputs without restructuring callers.

        **Race-safety is the driver's responsibility.** This method is
        called from lifespan startup *and* lazily from the first request
        that touches the store, possibly from multiple workers, possibly
        with the in-flight call being cancelled (e.g. nginx timeout
        propagating asyncio.CancelledError into a long-running CREATE
        INDEX). The driver MUST guarantee:

          - Concurrent callers serialize, in-process AND cross-process
            (multiple uvicorn workers / pods sharing the same backend).
          - A cancelled or crashed call cannot strand whatever
            serialization primitive was used (no orphaned advisory
            locks / phantom collection-creation flags).
          - Any schema migration step is atomic from the search side's
            point of view — there must never be a window where a
            previously-functional index/collection is absent.

        The 0.6.4 prod incident (see backend/CHANGELOG.md) is the
        canonical anti-example: pre-0.6.4 ``PgvectorStore`` had only
        an in-process ``asyncio.Lock`` + an ``_ensured`` bool, both of
        which a cancellation reset. The drop-then-create migration was
        non-atomic. Cross-process serialization (PG advisory lock) +
        atomic index swap (``CREATE _new`` → ``DROP legacy`` → ``RENAME``)
        was the fix, and that pattern's pgvector-specific shape is fine
        — but every other driver author has to solve the same problem
        with whatever primitives their backend exposes.

        Today's drivers (audit before swapping production):
          - ``PgvectorStore``: ✓ pg_advisory_xact_lock + atomic swap.
          - ``QdrantStore``: ⚠ only the ``_ensured_collection`` bool +
            ``collection_exists()`` check. Probably fine because Qdrant
            ``create_collection`` is idempotent server-side, but no
            explicit cross-process guard.
          - ``SeahorseCloudStore``: ⚠ BFF ``_bff_get_table()`` + optional
            auto-create; same race-window shape as Qdrant.
          - ``SeahorseDbStore``: ⚠ Coral ``GET /catalog/tables`` + optional
            auto-create on Coral; same race-window shape as the two ⚠
            above. Coral does serialize concurrent ``POST /catalog/tables``
            server-side, so racing peers mostly converge.
        All ⚠ drivers should be audited before they go to prod at
        scale; the asymmetry exists because only pgvector has ever
        actually shipped a schema migration step here.
