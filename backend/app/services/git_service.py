"""Git operations for Vault management.

Each Vault is a Git bare repo. This service handles:
- Vault (bare repo) initialization
- Reading files from HEAD
- Committing file changes (add/update/delete)
- Log and diff queries
- Cloning / fetching from an external remote (read-only mirror vaults)

Writes go through a persistent per-vault worktree linked to the bare repo
(`git worktree add`). No clone-per-commit, no push. The worktree shares
the object store with bare, so commits in the worktree update the bare's
refs directly. Concurrent writes against the same worktree are serialized
by a per-vault threading lock.

Remote ops (clone_mirror / fetch_remote / ls_remote_head) inject the auth
token into the URL only at command-invocation time and never persist it
to the bare repo's `.git/config`. That keeps the on-disk surface free of
secrets even when callers handed us a plaintext PAT.

        fail with "Unable to create '.../index.lock': File exists" until
        the lock is cleared by hand. Running this at startup recovers
        every affected vault before any worker can run into the same wall.

        Vault enumeration source: every `<storage>/<name>.git` bare repo
        in `storage_path`. Iterating bare repos (rather than the linked
        worktree dir) means we still find locks for vaults whose
        `_worktrees/<name>` directory was wiped or never created — the
        admin path inside the bare can hold an `index.lock` independently.

        Lock locations checked per vault:
          1. `<bare>/worktrees/<name>/index.lock` — where git keeps the
             index for linked worktrees (the path the AKB write paths
             actually touch).
          2. `<worktree>/.git/index.lock` — fallback for non-linked
             setups (initial clone path) where `.git` is a real dir.

        Safe under concurrency: the only write paths that touch a
        worktree's index hold `_vault_lock(vault_name)` per-vault, so
        startup self-heal — which runs before workers — cannot remove
        a lock held by a live operation. The age threshold provides
        defense in depth in the unlikely case startup overlaps with an
        in-flight commit (lock would be < 1s old, well under 60s).
