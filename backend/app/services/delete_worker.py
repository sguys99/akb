"""Background worker: drain vector_delete_outbox → vector_store.delete_point.

Post-Phase-4 the upsert side is owned by `embed_worker` (which now does
embed + sparse + upsert atomically — main PG no longer stores the dense
vector). What's left here is the delete pipeline:

- When chunks are removed from main PG, `enqueue_source_deletes` (called
  inside the same transaction as the chunks DELETE) records each
  chunk_id in `vector_delete_outbox`. That row outlives the chunks
  table — main PG forgets the chunk, but the outbox preserves the
  identifier the vector store needs to forget it too.
- This worker drains the outbox: vector_store.delete_point per row,
  retry-on-failure with backoff, periodic sweep of long-processed rows.

Indexing-queue stats (`pending_stats`) live in `embed_worker` — that's
where the indexing actually happens. This module owns delete only.

Loop mechanics live in `_backfill`.
