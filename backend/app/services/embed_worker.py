"""Background indexing worker — atomic embed + sparse + vector-store upsert.

Replaces the legacy two-stage pipeline (NULL → embedding, then
embedded → vector store) with a single per-chunk atomic stage. Main PG no longer stores the dense vector, so there's no value
in splitting the work across two queues.

Per-batch flow:
  1. Claim transaction (very short): mark up to BATCH_SIZE chunks as
     in-flight by pushing their next_attempt_at +10min, then commit.
     SKIP LOCKED keeps peer workers off these rows.
  2. Embedding API call OUTSIDE any transaction: external service
     latency must never lock PG conns or rows.
  3. Per-chunk transaction: encode sparse + vector_store.upsert_one
     (passing this conn — pgvector driver joins our transaction so
     the vector_index INSERT and chunks UPDATE commit together) +
     mark_success. Atomic. Failures back off via mark_failure on a
     separate small transaction.

The per-chunk model means a vector-store crash mid-batch still leaves
the SoT consistent — only the half-processed chunk reverts and gets
re-claimed on the next cycle.
