"""Collection lifecycle: explicit create + delete.

`create` is idempotent and emits `collection.create`. `delete` removes
the row outright (with an optional recursive cascade over docs + files)
and emits `collection.delete`. Anything that would mutate git happens
*outside* the PG cleanup transaction — same ordering as
`document_service.delete`.
