"""Unicode normalization helpers.

Why this exists: macOS filesystems (HFS+, APFS) store Hangul filenames
as NFD (decomposed jamo). When such filenames are read by a Python
script on macOS and forwarded to the backend verbatim, titles, paths,
and sometimes body text enter the database as NFD. BM25 tokenizers and
embedding models treat the NFD form as different tokens from NFC, so
queries typed in normal NFC never match the NFD-indexed content —
documents exist but are invisible to search.

Single source of truth for "make this NFC before we persist it" is
`to_nfc()`. The recursive variant normalizes arbitrarily nested
str/list/tuple/dict structures. A Pydantic mixin (`NFCModel`) applies
`to_nfc_any` to every field on instantiation, which is cheap (NFC is
idempotent) and catches anything caller-side normalization missed.

# ``akb://V/coll/frontend/file/X``, which the parser then mis-classifies
# as a file URI (coll="frontend", type="file", id="X"). Banning them
# at create time keeps the grammar unambiguous and matches the
