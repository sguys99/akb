"""Repository for `vault_files` — metadata for binary files stored in S3.

The actual file bytes never touch this layer; S3 access lives in
`services/adapters/s3_adapter.py`. Module-level functions take an
explicit `conn` so the caller controls the transaction boundary.

Collection membership is normalized via the FK `vault_files.collection_id`
referencing `collections.id`. NULL == vault root. The legacy free-form
`vault_files.collection` TEXT column was removed in migration 020.
