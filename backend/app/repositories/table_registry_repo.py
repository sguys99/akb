"""Repository for `vault_tables` — the registry of vault-scoped tables.

Module-level functions take an explicit `conn` so the caller controls
the transaction boundary. Same shape as `events_repo` — service code
composes repo calls under one `async with conn.transaction():` block.

Data tables (the `vt_***` PG tables that hold actual rows) live in
`table_data_repo`. This module only deals with the registry row.

Collection membership is normalized via FK `vault_tables.collection_id`
referencing `collections.id` (NULL == vault root). Table names remain
unique within a vault (NOT per-collection), so the PG-side
`pg_table_name(vault, name)` mapping is unchanged and a table can be
moved between collections without renaming.

      A table at collection ``X/Y`` has depth 2 from vault root; depth 1
      from prefix ``X``. Tables with ``collection_id IS NULL`` are at
      depth 0. ``max_depth < 0`` disables the depth filter
