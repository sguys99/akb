   under the license that applies to the directory you're contributing
   to:
   - Contributions to `packages/akb-mcp-client/` are licensed under the
     [MIT License](./packages/akb-mcp-client/LICENSE).
   - Contributions to every other directory (backend, frontend,
     deployment manifests, eval, etc.) are licensed under the
     [Business Source License 1.1](./LICENSE), including the
     Additional Use Grant currently in effect and the automatic
     conversion to the Change License (Apache 2.0) on the Change Date.

3. You grant Dnotitia, Inc. the right to relicense your contribution under
   any future license adopted by the AKB project — including a more

## Development Setup

```bash
# 1. Configure
cp config/app.yaml.example   config/app.yaml
cp config/secret.yaml.example config/secret.yaml
$EDITOR config/secret.yaml   # at minimum, set embed_api_key

# 2. Run the stack
docker compose up -d

# 3. Tail backend logs
docker compose logs -f backend
```

Backend code lives in `backend/app/`; the MCP server in `backend/mcp_server/`;
the frontend in `frontend/`. The stdio MCP proxy that ships on npm lives
under `packages/akb-mcp-client/`.

## Configuration

The backend reads exactly two YAML files — `app.yaml` (non-secret) and
`secret.yaml` (gitignored) — from `./config/` or `/etc/akb/`. **No environment
variables are read by the backend.** When you need a new setting:

1. Add the field with a sensible default to `Settings` in
   `backend/app/config.py`.
2. Add the same key (with explanatory comment) to
   `config/app.yaml.example` (or `secret.yaml.example` if it's a secret).

## Running Tests

```bash
# Backend E2E (requires the docker compose stack up)
AKB_URL=http://localhost:8000 bash backend/tests/test_e2e.sh
AKB_URL=http://localhost:8000 bash backend/tests/test_edit_e2e.sh
AKB_URL=http://localhost:8000 bash backend/tests/test_security_edge_e2e.sh
# … see backend/tests/ for the full list

# Frontend
cd frontend && pnpm test
```

The E2E suites create ephemeral users and vaults and clean up after
themselves. They poll `/health` for indexing completion before running search
assertions, so a slow remote embedding endpoint won't cause flakes.

## Code Style

- **Python**: ruff (configured in `backend/pyproject.toml`, line length 120).
  Run `ruff check backend/app` before submitting.
- **TypeScript / React**: follow the existing patterns; the codebase is
  consistent with React 19 + Radix UI + Tailwind v4 conventions.

## Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] All E2E suites pass against your local stack.
- [ ] No secrets, internal hostnames/IPs, or personal info in commits or
      diffs (check `git diff` carefully).
- [ ] New configuration is reflected in `config/*.yaml.example`.
- [ ] User-facing behaviour changes are noted in the PR description.

## Commit Messages

Conventional-commit-ish prefixes are used in the existing history:
`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `docs:`, `test:`. Keep the subject
line under 72 characters.

## Reporting Issues

For non-security bugs and feature requests, open an issue. For security
vulnerabilities, follow [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) — do not open a public
issue.
