agents reading and writing into a permissioned knowledge vault of docs, tables, and files, linked by a URI graph

# AKB — Agent Knowledge Base

## Works with

Any agent client that speaks **MCP (Streamable HTTP or stdio)**:

- **Claude Code** — CLI / VS Code / JetBrains
- **Claude Desktop** — macOS / Windows
- **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, **Cline**, **Continue** — via the
  [`akb-mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/akb-mcp) stdio proxy
- Custom agents — direct HTTP `POST /mcp/` with a Bearer token

## Why AKB

Most knowledge tools are built for humans clicking through a UI. Agents need a
different shape: structured documents, semantic + keyword search in one call,
explicit relations, and full version history. AKB gives agents a single set of
tools (`akb_put`, `akb_search`, `akb_browse`, `akb_relations`, …) over a
backing store of Git bare repos and a PostgreSQL hybrid index.

## Retrieval quality

Memory is only useful if the right note comes back. AKB's hybrid retrieval
(dense + BM25, source-level dedup) was benchmarked on
[LongMemEval](https://github.com/xiaowu0162/LongMemEval)-S — 500 long-context
questions, ~50 chat sessions per question. **Recall@5 = 98.4%**, with no
reranker in the loop.

| System | R@5 | n | Reranker | Source |
|---|---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| **AKB hybrid** | **98.4%** | 500 | no | this repo |
| MemPalace hybrid + rerank | 98.4% | 450 | yes | [MemPalace](https://github.com/mempalace/mempalace) |
| gbrain hybrid | 97.6% | 500 | no | [gbrain-evals](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain-evals) |
| gbrain vector | 97.4% | 500 | no | gbrain-evals |

Methodology, per-category breakdown, and a one-command reproducible harness
live in [`eval/longmemeval/`](eval/longmemeval/). The embedding model differs
across systems (AKB: `bge-m3@1024`), so read this as a stack-level comparison.

## Design philosophy

**Core stays small; flexibility comes from extension, not built-in
automation.** AKB does not ship its own consolidator, summariser, or
"knowledge gardener" — instead every write emits a structured event to a
Redis Stream (`akb:events`). Operators wire any external consumer
(periodic synthesis bot, doc-rot reaper, weekly-digest agent, audit
trail, …) on top, with no patches to the core. The base contract is a
read/write store; opinions about *what to do with* the knowledge live
outside.

```

PostgreSQL is the source of truth — chunk text + metadata + BM25 vocab.
The vector store is a driver-pluggable derived index holding dense
embeddings and corpus-side sparse vectors. Full vector-store loss is
recoverable from PG by setting `chunks.vector_indexed_at = NULL` and
letting the indexing worker re-populate.

## Key Concepts

- **Vault** — A Git bare repo. The unit of access control and physical isolation.
- **Collection** — A directory inside a vault. Topical grouping of documents.
- **Document** — Markdown + YAML frontmatter, optimised for agent read/write.
- **Hybrid Search** — Dense (semantic) + BM25 (lexical) fused via RRF in one call.
- **Relations** — `depends_on`, `related_to`, `implements` in frontmatter form an explicit knowledge graph.
- **Vault isolation in `akb_sql`** — Enforced by PostgreSQL ACL. Each
  AKB user has a corresponding PG role (`akb_user_<uid>`) and each
  vault has three group roles (`akb_vault_<vid>_{reader,writer,admin}`).
  `akb_sql` runs the user's SQL inside a transaction with
  `SET LOCAL ROLE`; cross-vault references return PG `42501`
  directly. No application-side regex inspects user SQL for forbidden
  identifiers. See `docs/designs/pg-native-rbac/`.

## MCP Tools (selection)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `akb_list_vaults` / `akb_create_vault` | Vault management |
| `akb_put` / `akb_get` / `akb_update` / `akb_delete` | Document CRUD (Git commit + indexing) |
| `akb_put_file` / `akb_get_file` / `akb_delete_file` | File attachments — proxy-side (requires local filesystem) |
| `akb_create_table` / `akb_alter_table` / `akb_drop_table` / `akb_sql` | Tabular content — per-doc tables + SQL |
| `akb_browse` | Tree traversal (collection → docs) |
| `akb_search` / `akb_grep` | Hybrid search (dense + BM25) / literal grep |
| `akb_drill_down` | Section-level retrieval |
| `akb_relations` / `akb_link` / `akb_unlink` / `akb_graph` | Knowledge graph |
| `akb_edit` / `akb_diff` / `akb_history` | In-place edit, diff, Git history |
| `akb_grant` / `akb_revoke` / `akb_set_public` | Permission boundaries — per-user, per-org, public |
| `akb_publish` / `akb_unpublish` | Public publication |

Agent memory and session lifecycle are not MCP tools — they live on
the dedicated `/api/v1/agent-sessions` REST surface, driven by AKB
lifecycle plugins (`akb-claude-code`, `akb-cursor`, …) that hook into
the agent's own SessionStart / PreCompact / SessionEnd events. As an
agent, your own memory vault (`agent-memory-{username}`) is browsable
through the standard `akb_search` / `akb_browse` / `akb_get` tools
exactly like any other vault.

The full tool catalogue is exposed via `akb_help()` from any MCP client.

## Document Format

Every vault resource has a location-aware AKB URI — the canonical handle
used by every tool and stored in relations. As of 0.3.0:

```
akb://{vault}                                          vault root (browse target)
akb://{vault}/coll/{coll_path}                         collection (browse target)
akb://{vault}[/coll/{coll_path}]/doc/{filename}        document
akb://{vault}[/coll/{coll_path}]/table/{name}          table
akb://{vault}[/coll/{coll_path}]/file/{uuid}           file
```

The `/coll/{coll_path}` segment is omitted for resources at the vault
root. Walking up a URI to its parent collection is a pure string
operation — paste the parent into `akb_browse(uri=...)` to list
siblings without an extra lookup.

# Payment API v2 migration plan
...
```

## Quick Start

AKB ships as a **3-container stack** (PostgreSQL with pgvector + backend +
frontend). For semantic (dense) search you bring an OpenAI-compatible
embedding endpoint (OpenAI, OpenRouter, self-hosted vLLM/TEI, etc.). It is
not strictly required: with no embed endpoint (or during an outage) the
pgvector and Qdrant drivers **degrade to BM25-only** lexical search rather
than returning nothing — dense is genuinely optional end-to-end (the
`seahorse-db` driver is the exception; see *Vector store* below). Prefer
running a separate Qdrant cluster, or pointing at Seahorse? See *Vector
store* below.

```bash
# 1. Configure
cp config/app.yaml.example   config/app.yaml
cp config/secret.yaml.example config/secret.yaml
$EDITOR config/secret.yaml   # set embed_api_key (and jwt_secret for any non-local deploy)

# 2. Run
docker compose up -d

# 3. Open
open http://localhost:3000
```

`config/app.yaml` and `config/secret.yaml` are the **single source of runtime
configuration** — no environment variables are read by the backend. Mount the
`config/` directory at `/etc/akb/` in any deployment.

### Vector store (driver-pluggable)

Hybrid search (dense + BM25 sparse, RRF-fused) runs through a driver
interface. Five drivers ship; pick at config time:

- **`pgvector`** (default) — uses the same Postgres container that holds
  application data. The pgvector/pgvector image pre-installs the
  extension; the driver creates a separate `vector_index` schema, so the
  main `chunks` table stays plain PostgreSQL. RRF fusion runs
  application-side. No external service to operate.
- **`qdrant`** — runs a separate Qdrant container; native RRF via the
  Query API. Useful when you already operate Qdrant or want to scale
  the vector store independently of Postgres.
- **`seahorse-cloud`** — points at a managed [Seahorse Cloud][shc] table
  over its BFF management API + per-table data-plane host (Bearer auth).
  No infrastructure to run on your side; you provision a table in the
  Seahorse console (or let the driver auto-create one) and AKB stores
  its chunks there. Native RRF, server-side BM25. See
  [`docs/vector-store-seahorse.md`](./docs/vector-store-seahorse.md)
  for the end-to-end setup walkthrough (sign-up → token → schema →
  config).
- **`seahorse-db`** — points at a **self-hosted SeahorseDB** cluster via
  its Coral coordinator HTTP API. You run Coral + Writer + Reader(s) +
  Redis + Kafka + a sparse-embedding server yourself (the SeahorseDB
  monorepo's `deploy/docker-compose.yml` brings up a minimal single-box
  stack). Native dense+sparse hybrid. Unlike the other drivers it does
  **not** support BM25-only fallback when the embed API is down (its
  sparse path is server-side and structurally coupled to a live embed
  step) — keep an embedding endpoint reachable for this driver.
- **`seahorse-db-grpc`** *(experimental)* — same Coral coordinator as
  `seahorse-db`, same `seahorsedb_*` settings, but talks gRPC instead
  of REST/JSONL. Coral merges axum + tonic onto a single listener so
  the port doesn't change; only the wire format does. Trades the JSON
  parsing path (and a class of foot-guns like INT64 sign mismatch and
  Arrow JSON decoder edge cases) for typed protobuf messages and an
  Arrow IPC streaming result. Prefer the REST driver for production
  until the gRPC variant clears its own QPS / recall benchmark. Same
  CRUD parity with REST (passes the same 25-scenario hybrid e2e), but
  it has not yet had the production-scale exposure the REST driver
  has.

Switching drivers is a config edit (no schema migration on the main DB):

```bash
# Default flow targets pgvector.
docker compose up

# Qdrant:
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.qdrant.yaml up
$EDITOR config/app.yaml     # vector_store_driver: qdrant
                            # vector_url: http://qdrant:6333

# Seahorse Cloud (managed; full guide in docs/vector-store-seahorse.md):
docker compose up           # no extra container needed
$EDITOR config/app.yaml     # vector_store_driver: seahorse-cloud
                            # seahorse_cloud_tenant_uuid: <your tenant>
                            # seahorse_cloud_table_name: <your table>
$EDITOR config/secret.yaml  # seahorse_cloud_token: shsk_<...>

# SeahorseDB (self-hosted cluster reached via the Coral coordinator):
docker compose up           # run the SeahorseDB stack separately
$EDITOR config/app.yaml     # vector_store_driver: seahorse-db
                            # seahorsedb_coordinator_url: http://localhost:3003
                            # seahorsedb_table_name: akb_chunks
```

Embedding model + dimensions are also fully pluggable via
`embed_base_url` / `embed_model` / `embed_dimensions` — the codebase has
no hard-coded model. For pgvector with HNSW, keep `embed_dimensions ≤ 2000`
(or 4000 with `halfvec`); larger models fall back to exact scan.
Qdrant / Seahorse (cloud or db) have no such limit (Qdrant up to 65536,
Seahorse up to its table-defined dim).

### LLM features (optional)

LLM is only used by the `metadata_worker` to auto-tag documents imported via
external git mirroring. Core CRUD/search works without it. To enable, set
`llm_base_url` / `llm_model` in `app.yaml` and `llm_api_key` in `secret.yaml`.

### Event fanout (optional)

The PG `events` outbox is always written. Set `redis_url` in `app.yaml` to
have the `events_publisher` worker drain the outbox to a Redis Stream
(`akb:events`) so external services can subscribe via `XREAD` / consumer
groups. Leave blank to disable; events still accumulate in PG and you can
build an SSE endpoint on top of the LISTEN/NOTIFY trigger without Redis.

### Production deployment

For Kubernetes, see [`deploy/k8s/README.md`](./deploy/k8s/README.md). The
`deploy/k8s/` directory contains a generic kustomize base; provide your
own registry, hostname, and TLS issuer via the documented env vars or an
operator-private overlay under `deploy/k8s/internal/`.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.14, FastAPI, Uvicorn, asyncpg, GitPython, MCP SDK
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 (main DB needs no extension; the same
  pgvector/pgvector image hosts the optional vector_index schema)
- **Vector store**: driver-pluggable (pgvector default; Qdrant,
  Seahorse Cloud, or self-hosted SeahorseDB optional — hybrid dense +
  BM25 sparse, RRF fusion; BM25-only fallback when embed is down)
- **Event stream** (optional): PG `events` outbox + Redis Streams fanout
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, Radix UI
- **Auth**: JWT + Personal Access Tokens (PATs)
- **MCP**: Streamable HTTP (backend) + stdio proxy (`akb-mcp` on npm)

## Versioning

AKB follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/). The product version lives in
`backend/pyproject.toml` (`[project].version`) and is mirrored to
`frontend/package.json` via `scripts/bump-version.sh <x.y.z>`. Each
`deploy/k8s/deploy.sh` run tags the Docker images with both the explicit
version (`:${VERSION}`) and `:latest`, so historical builds remain
pullable for rollback.

`packages/akb-mcp-client` (the `akb-mcp` npm proxy) follows its own npm
semver lifecycle and is **not** tied to the product version.

## License

The AKB backend, frontend, and deployment manifests are licensed under
the [Business Source License 1.1](./LICENSE) — source-available, with
an Additional Use Grant that permits production use (commercial or
non-commercial) up to a seat-count threshold, automatically converting
to **Apache License 2.0** four years after each version's first public
release.

The npm `akb-mcp` proxy (`packages/akb-mcp-client/`) is separately
licensed under the **MIT License** so it can be freely embedded in any
agent client without restriction.

**Free production use of the backend** — you may deploy AKB in
production, commercial or not, provided your aggregate deployment
serves **fewer than 100 Named Seats** (distinct human user accounts in
the `users` table, per deployment; service accounts and
90-day-inactive accounts excluded — see [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for the
precise definition).

**Commercial license required** for any of:

- Production use of the backend at or above 100 Named Seats.
- Offering AKB (modified or not) as a hosted service, on-premises
  product, embedded component, or rebranded distribution to third
  parties — regardless of seat count.
